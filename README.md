# Landing-Page-Project
This is my second official project, where I focused more on my ability to make the webpage more pleasing to look at and also more user friendly by using flexbox. It took a while to get complete as I had to utilize many different resources in order to understand some of the tasks. As with the last one, I had issues trying to push the files onto github, until I realized I had to make a new SSH key.

Lots of learning and trial and error involved in all aspects of the project, but I am proud of my work and I really feel that this is a wonderful representation of my beginner skills as of currently.
